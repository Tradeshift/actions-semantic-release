# @tradeshift/actions-semantic-release

Huzzah!

This is a fork of
[cycjimmy/semantic-release-action](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action)
with fixed `semantic-release` version and custom `semantic-release` config to
allow publishing to other registries.

The `semantic-release/npm` plugin has no good way of publishing to custom registries,
without relying on `package.json` `publishConfig` values. Changing the package
depending on registry makes it impossible to cross-publish

By using `npm publish` directly, this action works around these limitations of
[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

This action can also be used with non published packages to do github release
management.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for input/outputs.

## Example usage

  - name: ðŸš€ Release
